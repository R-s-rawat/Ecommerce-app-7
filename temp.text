// added 5 folders besides basic(config folder containing db-connect file) for mvc of web-app

// keep the separation of concerns, like helpers(or utils), routes, controllers, models, middlewares

// we define userSchema (for new website visitors tracing), and saving to database

// we create a auth Route (for new users ), for proper app routing the new users data to database(creating route through ExpressJS)

// as we following mvc, we create controllers for routing
