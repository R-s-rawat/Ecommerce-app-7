 public/

# If the parent .gitignore ignore (PUBLIC) then Git never even looks inside public/ if the parent already told it to ignore the whole folder.

# Adding client prefix(as it points to client folder) before the public folders worked, as it points to directories and files correctly ðŸ”¥
# Ignore everything in public folder
client/public/*

# But don't ignore the folder itself
!client/public/

# Ignore not whole public files But NOT these files/folders
